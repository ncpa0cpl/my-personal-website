  A JavaScript/TypeScript data validation 
  library.

  Library that I've created to address an 
  issue I had when working on some of my 
  projects. Although there are already great 
  libraries that help with validating data, 
  however in most cases you are forced to 
  define and maintain two separate 
  definitions of the same data structure, 
  one to validate at runtime and a TypeScript 
  type definition.

  Dilswer is my attempt to provide a 
  mechanism that would allow to have only 
  one such type declaration that can be 
  used both at runtime and within the 
  TypeScript type system.
